Welcome to the Conway3D Minecraft Mod. This mod was created for the youtube video: "Simulating Life in Minecraft | Conways Game of Life in 3D", found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBjG-6RyB48&t=1s.

The mod adds a "Conway Block" and "Game Controller" item to the game. It additionally adds the "/resetConwayBlocks" command.

The mod allows the well-known 0 player game to be simulated in Minecraft. I hope you enjoy!

The latest build can be found at /build/libs/conway3d-1.0.0.jar

To set-up the mod:
- Download fabric loader for 1.21.1
- Download mod jar file
- Download fabric api jar file for 1.21.1
- Launch fabric and enjoy!

MOD DETAILS:
- Conway Block item - found in the Redstone section of the creative menu.
- Game Controller - also found in the Redstone section of the creative menu.
- /resetConwayBlocks - removes all conway blocks from game's memory, essentially freezing these cells. You should use this command each time you want to try a different set-up otherwise the old blocks will keep updating.

- The mod only registers conways blocks that are placed/broken by hand or created by the simulation, so using world-edit or /fill won't work.
- The game rules can be edited by left clicking the game controller.
- The simulation can be advanced interacting (right click) with the game controller.
  - Side note: if you hold down right click it will keep advancing.
