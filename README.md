Welcome to the Conway3D Minecraft Mod. This mod was created for the youtube video: "Simulating Life in Minecraft | Conways Game of Life in 3D", found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBjG-6RyB48&t=1s.

The mod adds a "Conway Block" and "Game Controller" item to the game. It additionally adds the "/resetConwayBlocks" command.

The mod allows the well-known 0 player game to be simulated in Minecraft. I hope you enjoy!

The latest build can be found at /build/libs/conway3d-1.0.0.jar
